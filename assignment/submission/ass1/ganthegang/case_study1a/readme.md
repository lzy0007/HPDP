3. For each scorecard chart, the "Chart type" is selected with **"Scorecard chart"** and the "Data range" is filled with the value **"Dataset1!P2:P111520"** which consists of the values in the column P in "Dataset1" sheet. Then, the aggregate checkbox is enabled and a different aggregated function is selected.

4. In the next steps, a column chart is created by selecting **"Column chart"** as the chart type with the data range values of **"Dataset1!Q2:Q111520"**. Check the "Aggregated" to obtain the counts of students for each grade.

6. Despite having a column chart, a pivot table with a count of each grade is also created. For each grade, the count is made on column Q, Dataset 1 sheet. The "COUNIF()" function is used to obtain the aggregated value of the sum for each grade. The function is shown in Figure 24 and is modified by substituting the "A+" for the other grades.

8. For visualizing the number of pass/fail students, a chart with a chart type of **"Doughnut chart"** is created. The data range is set to **"Dataset1!R2:R111520"**
<p align="center">
